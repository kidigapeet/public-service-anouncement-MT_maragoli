# Starts uvicorn on localhost and opens a Cloudflare quick tunnel to it, which
# gives back a public https://<random>.trycloudflare.com address. Nothing is
# installed system-wide and no Cloudflare account is needed.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: permanent. A quick tunnel's hostname is random and changes
# every time this script runs, and the URL dies when this process or the node
# does. Use it for a live demo. For a link that has to keep working - a link in
# a paper - the service has to outlive the session.
#
# Loads models from artifacts/ when they are present, so on the training node it
# starts in seconds and needs no Hugging Face token at all.
#
# Deliberately uses NO curl, wget or git: the GPU node has none of them. Python
# is the one interpreter a Jupyter node is guaranteed to have, so it does the
# downloading and the health-checking too.
